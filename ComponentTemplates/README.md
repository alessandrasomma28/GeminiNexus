# Component Templates 
This section is intended to gather demonstration templates of individual components that can be connected and enabled within the platform.

Within each folder there's a brief description of the component concerned and its associated functionality, as well as the files needed to deploy the component.

The templates are divided by components belonging to the FIWARE catalogue (available here: [FIWARE Catalogue](https://www.fiware.org/catalogue/)) and external components. 

## Templates

1. [Orion Context Broker (LD version)](https://github.com/alessandrasomma28/GeminiNexus/tree/main/ComponentTemplates/Orion-LD%20Context%20Broker) as a core component for managing entities.
